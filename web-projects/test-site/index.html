	Next up is <a href="https://www.karbachbrewing.com/">Karbach</a> This place got a lot of flack for selling out to the big guys but I still like it. It's close to work and has a great outdoor area for concerts.

<p>
	Finally there is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alesatanhouston/">Brash</a> Some of the best beer to me. The brewery is in an old warehouse where they play non stop heavy metal, it's perfect!
